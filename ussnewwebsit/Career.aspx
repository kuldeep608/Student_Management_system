    <p>
        The career page can have testimonials from clients and employees along with their name, picture and designation. Providing resources to verify the information can complement the authenticity of the testimonials you include. Use pictures and details of awards won by the company and its employees. Provide links that can take the user to web pages about events. You can also post links to pages with information regarding the contributions of employees. For example, you can share links of employees' contributions to impactful Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

        6. Keep open job listings organised

        Before we discuss the steps to help you learn how to create a career page, it is important to provide information about career pages and their purpose Content and design and two important aspects of a webpage. Once you decide to create a career page, consult with top management, human resources, content writers, web designers and digital marketing teams to identify their requirements. You can make your career page informative and engaging to hold a reader's attention. Follow these steps to create a company career page that can hold a candidate's attention and attract the right talent for your company:

        A company's homepage may contain details of its vision, mission and business strategies. A career page can have content exclusively focusing on job opportunities, career growth prospects and work culture. The home page and the career's page are typically in sync with each other, in terms of tone and language. Highlight the salient features of your business operation and how you differ from other organisations working in the same domain.

        If your company enables higher learning, guarantees a healthy work-life balance and promotes employee engagement, consider expanding on these policies in the career page. This page can have multiple audiovisual elements that show employees in their workspaces, pictures from employee engagement programmes and information about incentive schemes and reward initiatives.
