        So, people have landed on your site. They already saw the homepage where you introduce your blog, products, or services. Now they want to find more information about the person or people behind the products or services you offer. This is when they look for your “About Us” page – to know more about you! The page can go by different names – “About”, “Our story” – but their purpose is the same. To tell visitors who you are, and why they should choose your business!

       When visitors first land on your site, you’re a stranger to them. Use this page to explain to them what it is that you do, and why you do it. They should be presented with clear information about you or your business.

      Don’t think of this section as an obligation and only write a few paragraphs here and there. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to share your stories, values and build trust between you and your site visitors. When people know who you are, what you do, what you believe in, they are more likely to trust and do business with you.
   
      Every business has a story to tell. We believe an “About” page should always include a piece of the story about you or your company. This is especially true for bloggers and smaller companies. People love brands with personalities nowadays. And stories are powerful mediums for you to connect with your audience. People tell stories. It’s what we do as humans!

      How did you come up with the idea of this blog or this company? When did you decide to pursue this idea? How has it grown during all those times? Don’t be afraid to summarize and share such experiences in a piece of writing. Try to encapsulate your history and development in just a few paragraphs. You don’t have to be a book author to write one, and you certainly don’t need to make it lengthy.

      You should definitely mention the “Aha!” moment that led to the creation of your blog, products, or services. In addition to that, you may want to include the important milestones that you or your company achieve over time. Milestones are your company’s history, so be proud of them! And who knows, you might inspire some visitors with your compelling story and history.
